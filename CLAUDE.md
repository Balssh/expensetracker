# CLAUDE.md - Go TUI Expense Tracker

This document outlines the architecture, tech stack, and implementation plan for a command-line expense and income tracker application written in Go. The application will feature a Terminal User Interface (TUI).

## üèõÔ∏è 1. Architecture

We will use **Clean Architecture**. This separates the project into distinct layers, ensuring that the core business logic is independent of the UI, database, and other external frameworks. The dependency rule is strict: dependencies only point inwards, from outer layers to inner layers.

The layers are:
1.  **Entities:** The core domain objects (`Expense`, `Income`, `Category`). These have no dependencies.
2.  **Use Cases:** The application's business logic (e.g., `AddExpense`, `ListIncomes`). Depends only on Entities.
3.  **Interface Adapters:** The bridge between the core logic and the outside world. This includes our TUI components, which will translate user input into calls to the Use Cases.
4.  **Frameworks & Drivers:** The outermost layer, containing implementation details like the TUI library (`Bubble Tea`) and the database driver (`go-sqlite3`).

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Tech Stack

-   **TUI Library:** **Bubble Tea**. A functional, Elm-inspired framework that is excellent for managing state in complex TUI applications. We'll use its companion libraries, `Bubbles` for UI components and `Lip Gloss` for styling.
-   **Database:** **SQLite**. A serverless, file-based database perfect for a local desktop application.
-   **Database Driver:** **`mattn/go-sqlite3`**. The most popular and robust SQLite driver for Go.
-   **CLI Argument Parsing:** **Cobra**. For potential future command-line subcommands (e.g., quick-add functionality).

## üìÇ 3. Project Structure

The project will follow a standard Go project layout that aligns with Clean Architecture principles.

## üóÑÔ∏è 4. Database Schema

We'll start with four simple tables in our SQLite database to track both expenses and income.

**`expense_categories` table:**
- `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- `name` TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE

**`expenses` table:**
- `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- `description` TEXT NOT NULL
- `amount` REAL NOT NULL
- `date` TEXT NOT NULL
- `category_id` INTEGER
- `FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES expense_categories(id)`

**`income_categories` table:**
- `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- `name` TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE

**`income` table:**
- `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- `description` TEXT NOT NULL
- `amount` REAL NOT NULL
- `date` TEXT NOT NULL
- `category_id` INTEGER
- `FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES income_categories(id)`

## üé® 5. UX/UI Design Guidelines

### 5.1 TUI Design Principles

## üë• 6. User Stories

### 6.1 Core User Personas

**Sarah - Budget-Conscious Student**
- Needs to track every expense to stay within limited budget
- Values quick entry and simple categorization
- Uses application daily for small transactions

**Mike - Small Business Owner**
- Tracks both personal and business expenses
- Needs detailed reporting for tax purposes

### 6.2 Detailed User Stories

#### Daily Usage Stories
```
As Sarah (student), I want to quickly add an expense while on-the-go
So that I can track my spending without interrupting my day
Given I have the application open
When I press 'a' and enter "Coffee $4.50"
Then the expense should be saved with today's date and default category
And I should return to the dashboard with updated balance
```

```
As Mike (business owner), I want to categorize my transactions properly
So that I can generate accurate reports for accounting
Given I'm adding a new expense
When I select the category field
Then I should see a list of existing categories plus option to create new
And I should be able to filter categories by typing
```

#### Analytics and Reporting Stories
```
As Elena (family manager), I want to see spending trends over time
So that I can identify areas where we're overspending
Given I have 3+ months of transaction data
When I navigate to the analytics view
Then I should see charts showing spending by category and month
And I should be able to compare current month to previous months
```

```
As Mike (business owner), I want to export my transaction data
So that I can import it into my accounting software
Given I have transactions for a specific date range
When I select export options
Then I should be able to choose CSV or JSON format
And specify date range and transaction types to include
```

#### Advanced User Stories
```
As a power user, I want to set up recurring transactions
So that I don't have to manually enter fixed monthly expenses
Given I have a monthly subscription expense
When I set it as recurring with frequency and amount
Then it should automatically appear each month for confirmation
```

```
As Elena (accessibility user), I want to use the app with screen reader
So that I can manage finances despite visual impairment
Given I'm using a screen reader
When I navigate through the application
Then all interface elements should be properly labeled and announced
And I should be able to complete all tasks using keyboard only
```

#### Error Handling Stories
```
As any user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong
So that I can understand and fix issues quickly
Given the database becomes temporarily unavailable
When I try to add a transaction
Then I should see a clear error message explaining the problem
And suggestions for what to do next
```

## üõ†Ô∏è 7. Development Guidelines

### 7.1 Code Standards and Conventions

**Go Style Guidelines:**
- Follow official Go formatting (`gofmt`, `goimports`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (max 50 lines)
- Use interfaces for testability and flexibility
- Handle errors explicitly, never ignore them

**Clean Architecture Compliance:**
- Strict dependency direction (inward only)
- No direct database imports in use case layer
- All external dependencies injected via interfaces
- Domain entities should have no external dependencies

**Code Organization:**
```go
// Example use case structure
type AddExpenseUseCase struct {
    expenseRepo ExpenseRepository
    categoryRepo CategoryRepository
}

func (uc *AddExpenseUseCase) Execute(expense domain.Expense) error {
    // Validation
    if err := expense.Validate(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid expense: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Business logic
    return uc.expenseRepo.Create(expense)
}
```

### 7.2 Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

**Commit Guidelines:**
- Use conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, style, chore
- Examples: `feat(tui): add expense filtering`, `fix(db): handle connection timeout`

**Pull Request Process:**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Run full test suite and linting
4. Create PR with clear description and screenshots
5. Code review and approval required
6. Squash merge to maintain clean history

### 7.3 Performance Considerations

**Database Optimization:**
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Implement connection pooling for concurrent operations
- Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Paginate large result sets

**TUI Performance:**
- Minimize re-renders by optimizing model updates
- Use efficient data structures for large transaction lists
- Implement virtual scrolling for very long lists
- Cache frequently accessed data

**Memory Management:**
- Close database connections properly
- Avoid memory leaks in long-running TUI sessions
- Profile memory usage during development
- Use appropriate data structures for scale

### 7.4 Security Best Practices

**Data Protection:**
- Store database file in user's home directory with restricted permissions
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Never log sensitive financial data

**Input Validation:**
```go
func (e *Expense) Validate() error {
    if e.Amount <= 0 {
        return errors.New("amount must be positive")
    }
    if len(e.Description) == 0 || len(e.Description) > 200 {
        return errors.New("description must be 1-200 characters")
    }
    return nil
}
```

### 7.5 Debugging and Troubleshooting

**Logging Strategy:**
- Use structured logging with levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Log to file in debug mode for troubleshooting
- Never log sensitive financial information
- Include correlation IDs for tracing user actions

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=true ./expense-tracker

# Run with database logging
DB_DEBUG=true ./expense-tracker
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Database locked**: Handle SQLite concurrent access properly
- **Terminal size**: Test with various terminal dimensions
- **Unicode support**: Ensure proper UTF-8 handling for international users
